 Define a k-periodic string as follows:
 A String s Is k-periodic If the length Of the String |s| Is a multiple Of k, And If you chop the
 String up into |s|/k substrings Of length k, then each of those substrings (except the
 first) Is the same as the previous substring, but with its last character moved to the
 front.
 For example, the following string Is 3-periodic
 abccabbcaabc
 The above String can break up into substrings abc, cab, bca, And abc, And Each
 substring(except the first) Is a right-rotation Of the previous substring (abccab
 bca abc).
 Given a String, determine the smallest k For which the String Is k-periodic.
 Input
 Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple
 times on different inputs. The single line of input contains a string s (1≤|s|≤100)
 consisting only Of lowercase letters.
 Output
 Output the Integer k, which Is the smallest k For which the input String Is k-periodic
