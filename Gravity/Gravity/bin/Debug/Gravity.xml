 Consider a 2D grid, which contains apples, obstacles, and open spaces. Gravity will pull
 the apples straight down, until they hit an obstacle, Or the bottom Of the grid, Or
 another apple which has already come To rest. Obstacles don't move. Given such a grid,
 determine where the apples eventually settle.
 Input
 Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple
 times on different inputs. The first line of input contains two integers, r And c
 (1≤r,c≤100), which are the number of rows And the number of columns of the grid. On
 each of the next r lines will be c characters: 'o’ (lowercase ‘Oh’) for an apple, ‘#’ for an
 obstacle, And '.’ for an open space.
 Output
 Output the grid, after the apples have fallen
